Description: 
  GTF.tool provides advanced functionalities for processing genomic annotation 
  files in GTF (Gene Transfer Format) and GFF formats. The package is 
  designed to handle large datasets from sources like NCBI, Ensembl, and GENCODE. 
  It includes tools for loading, filtering, sorting, optimizing, and extending 
  annotation data. Key features include:
    - Efficient loading and filtering of annotation files based on genetic elements 
      (e.g., genes, exons, CDS).
    - Sorting annotations by chromosome, strand, and genomic position.
    - Normalizing and optimizing GTF data by resolving naming conflicts and filling 
      missing annotations.
    - Creating CDS (coding sequence) regions based on exon coordinates grouped by transcript.
    - Inferring intron regions by identifying gaps between exons within the same transcript.
  The package leverages parallel processing for high performance, making it ideal 
  for large-scale genomic analyses.
